--> ChatBot 

Just a tiny chatbot in Python.  
It’s not ChatGPT… it’s more like your friendly neighbor who only knows a handful of phrases.  
I made it mostly to mess around with if-elif-else logic and basic input handling.

--> What it does
- Says hi back if you say hi, hello, or hey.
- Tells you the current time or date.
- Responds when you ask how are you or what’s your name.
- Pretends to know the weather.
- Knows when to say goodbye (bye, exit, quit).

--> How it works
It’s a **rule-based chatbot**. That means it doesn’t “think” —  
it just checks what you typed and picks a reply from a small set of rules.

Under the hood:
1. Waits for you to type something.
2. Cleans it up (lowercase + no extra spaces).
3. Runs through a bunch of if-elif checks.
4. Prints a reply.
5. Loops until you say goodbye.

That’s literally it.
